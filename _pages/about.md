I am a Computer Science student at Cornell University with interests in cryptos, stocks, systems, and machine learning.

Please feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or shoot me an email for future collabs on [side projects](https://github.com/cliu0013), [hackathons](https://devpost.com/cl2373), or [other endeavors](https://opensea.io/collection/cryptokitties). I speak Mandarin and English.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
